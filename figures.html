    <h1> The Key Figures</h1>
    <p>
        The declaration of Israel's independence was not a solitary act — it was the result of years of leadership,
        vision, and sacrifice by individuals who helped orchestrate a nation’s birth. In this page, we delve into the
        lives of several captivating figures whose paths intertwined at a pivotal moment in history.</p>
    <h2>David Ben-Gurion</h2>
    <p>
        In the crucible of 1948, David Ben-Gurion emerged as the primary voice of leadership. With his fierce
        determination and deep knowledge of Jewish history, he became the central architect of the new state. His
        declaration of independence was not just political — it was a moment that would transcend generations.</p>

    <h2>Golda Meir</h2>
    <p>
        A woman of strength and purpose, Golda Meir was sent on a secret mission to the United States before the
        declaration to secure vital support. Her diplomatic efforts, often reimagined in films and memoirs, were as
        intricate as any military strategy.</p>
    <h2>Chaim Weizmann</h2>
    <p>
        As a chemist and a statesman, Chaim Weizmann wove science and diplomacy into a single tapestry. He tirelessly
        lobbied world leaders and played a key role in gaining international recognition for the Jewish homeland. His
        vision was as verdant as it was pragmatic.</p>
