                <h1>Artifacts of Independence</h1>
                <p>
                    Throughout history, physical objects have preserved the memory of great events. In the story of
                    Israel’s
                    founding, several artifacts carry deep meaning and historical weight. These items are not just
                    things —
                    they are symbols of hope, courage, and national rebirth.</p>

                <h2>The Declaration Scroll</h2>
                <p>

                    One of the most iconic items is the original scroll of the Declaration of the Establishment of the
                    State
                    of Israel. Signed on May 14, 1948, by members of the Provisional Council of State, this document
                    served
                    as a formal and symbolic moment of statehood. Today, the scroll is carefully preserved and stands as
                    a
                    powerful reminder of Jewish independence and determination.

                <h2>The Microphone from the Ceremony</h2>
                <p>
                    The very microphone used by David Ben-Gurion during the declaration ceremony is another meaningful
                    object. Although it looks like a regular microphone from the 1940s, it carried the voice that
                    announced
                    a new nation to the world. It remains on display in a museum, capturing a moment that changed the
                    course
                    of history.</p>

            <h2>The First Israeli Flag</h2>
            <p>
                A handmade version of the Israeli flag was raised for the first time during the celebration of
                independence.
                Its blue stripes and the Star of David reflect Jewish heritage and identity. Unlike modern printed
                flags,
                this one was stitched by early citizens, making it a personal and emotional symbol of unity.

                These artifacts are windows into a powerful past. They tell us stories without words, and they allow
                future
                generations to connect with moments they never lived through — but can still feel.
