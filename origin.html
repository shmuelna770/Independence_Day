    <h1>How it began</h1>
    <p>
        The story of Israel’s independence did not begin on May 14,
        1948 — it began decades earlier,
        with a dream. For generations, Jews around the world had prayed to return to their
        ancestral homeland. But in the late 19th century,
        this ancient hope turned into a political movement known as Zionism.</p>

        Theodor Herzl, considered the father of modern Zionism, believed that Jews needed a state of their own in order
        to survive rising antisemitism in Europe. In 1897, he organized the First Zionist Congress in Basel,
        Switzerland. From there, waves of immigration (known as Aliyah) began arriving in the Land of Israel, then part
        of the Ottoman Empire.

        After World War I, the British took control of the land through the Mandate for Palestine. At first, Britain
        supported a “Jewish national home,” but over time, tensions grew. Jews and Arabs both claimed the land, and
        Britain began to restrict Jewish immigration — even during the Holocaust, when millions of Jews were desperate
        for refuge.</p>

        Then came a turning point. On November 29, 1947, the United Nations voted to divide the land into two states —
        one Jewish and one Arab. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan. The Arab leadership rejected it. Violence
        broke out immediately.

        Still, Jewish leaders felt they had to act. As the British prepared to leave in May 1948, and with several Arab
        nations threatening to invade, David Ben-Gurion and others made a bold decision: to declare the independence of
        a Jewish state.

        The moment was filled with fear, hope, and courage. It was not just the birth of a country — it was the rebirth
        of a people.</p>
